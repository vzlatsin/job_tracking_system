# Job Tracking System - Design Document

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Job Tracking System
- **Primary Goal:**
  - Track job execution counts across different production environments.
  - Provide visibility into job execution trends.
  - Detect missing or failed jobs to assist with troubleshooting.
  
## 2. Core Functionality
### **Phase 1 - Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**
- **Data Collection:**
  - Retrieve job execution counts from multiple sources.
  - Store job counts in a structured format.
  
- **Data Processing:**
  - Aggregate job counts from different environments.
  - Calculate total counts for reporting.

- **Data Storage:**
  - Persist daily job counts for future analysis.
  
### **Phase 2 - Enhancements**
- **Monitoring & Alerting:**
  - Detect discrepancies in job counts (e.g., missing jobs, unexpected failures).
  - Provide real-time job execution metrics.
  
- **Historical Analysis:**
  - Track execution patterns over time.
  - Identify anomalies and trends.

## 3. Data & Storage Considerations
- **What data will be stored?**
  - Job execution counts by date and environment.
  - Job details such as status, name, and execution time (future expansion).

- **How will data be accessed?**
  - Retrieve specific job execution counts by date.
  - Fetch aggregated totals for trend analysis.

## 4. Expected System Behavior
- **Data Collection should be reliable and efficient.**
- **Processing should handle missing data gracefully.**
- **Storage should allow efficient querying of historical records.**
- **The system should be extensible to support additional features in the future.**

## 5. Testing Strategy
- **First Test:** Verify job execution counts can be retrieved and processed correctly.
- **Next Tests:**
  - Ensure data is stored and retrieved accurately.
  - Handle missing or incorrect data gracefully.
  - Validate that calculations for aggregated totals are correct.

## 6. Deployment Considerations
- **Development Environment:** Windows (for initial development and testing).
- **Production Environment:** Linux (`ldctlm01` for deployment and execution).
- **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Application should be packaged and deployed efficiently.
  - Database should persist across deployments.
- **Monitoring:** The system should allow future integration with visualization tools.

### **Next Steps**
- Write an initial test for data collection and job count processing.
- Implement a minimal stub that allows tests to pass.
- Expand functionality based on evolving test cases.
